# OKB: Open Knowledge Bases

This is the repository for the Open Knowledge Bases Projektpraktikum & Forschungspraktikum at the University of Koblenz-Landau.

The aim of this research lab is to work on methods and applications that deal with multi-provenance knowledge in [Wikidata]. We will work with a use case scenario around news and events. On the one hand, we will work on a tool for gathering multi-view facts about events and encourage their curation in Wikidata. On the other hand, we will define and analyze methods to semi-automatically rank the collected multi-view facts according to Wikidata guidelines.
